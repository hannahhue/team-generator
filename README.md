# Team Generator

## Description

The team generator is a simple program made to quickly form teams and input thier info. Its made to take stress of the managers plate and help put their efforts towards more important goals. My motivation was to se if i could implement a class and extentions of said class into a full functioning generator. I appriciate the experience i gained with testing, even tho i hate it, and the ability to deal with class/subclasses. this will assist any team lead with assigning roles and inputing info quickly and easily.
